# DEXER
A disease symptoms detection chatbot.

## Inspiration

NO TREATMENT can reverse the progress of AD
Vital for us to identify at the earliest stage
and then prevent the disease asap.

## What it does

### Diagnosis:
- Spotting the below symptoms:
- Short-term memory loss
- Negative emotions
- Apathy

### Prevention:
- Decreased word fluency
- Monthly report for registered person (family /doctor)
- Daily causal interaction
- Daily learning & “brain-training” game
- Encourage interaction with family & society



## How we built it

Using Azure and node.js

## Challenges we ran into

-Deployment on Skype because Skype does not support some of the features.
-Integrating Luis and QnA Maker.
-Getting the username and storing it in the Azure Table Storage
-Sending the email to the relatives of the patient if the stage of the disease is intense.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-No such product which provides the preventive diagnosis of AZ disease patients exists.
-Collaborated a lot of Microsoft services in our bot on a single platform successfully.
-We were able to achieve our purpose within the 24 hours hackathon.


## What we learned
-Some not commonly used Node JS functions.
-Making herocards
-Connecting bots to different platforms
-Marketing of our new product
-Text analytics using different APIS


## What's next for DEXER - Redefining Preventive Diagnosis for AD
